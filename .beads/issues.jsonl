{"id":"RocketIndex-p82","title":"Extract documentation comments","description":"AI agents constantly need to understand what code does without reading full implementations. Doc comments are the primary source of intent.\n\n## Problem\nAI agents must read entire functions to understand purpose. Doc comments exist but aren't indexed.\n\n## Solution\nTree-sitter exposes doc comments:\n- F#: `///` XML doc comments (often as `comment` nodes with specific prefix)\n- Python: Docstrings (first string literal in function/class body)\n- Ruby: `#` comments, YARD `# @param` etc.\n\n1. Add `doc: Option\u003cString\u003e` field to Symbol struct\n2. Extract doc comments that precede symbol definitions\n3. Include in `rkt def` output\n4. Add `rkt doc \"SymbolName\"` command for just the documentation\n5. Enables AI agents to quickly understand function purpose\n\n## Example output\n```\n$ rkt doc \"PaymentService.processPayment\"\n/// Processes a payment transaction\n/// \u003cparam name=\"amount\"\u003eAmount in cents\u003c/param\u003e\n/// \u003creturns\u003eResult with confirmation ID or error\u003c/returns\u003e\n```\n\n## Affected files\n- `crates/rocketindex/src/lib.rs`\n- `crates/rocketindex/src/languages/*.rs`\n- `crates/rocketindex/src/db.rs`\n- `crates/rocketindex-cli/src/main.rs`","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-05T21:39:31.649139-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-05T21:39:31.649139-08:00"}
