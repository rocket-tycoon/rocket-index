During heavy activity (e.g., git checkout switching branches), this causes many small transactions.\n\n**Proposed solution:**\nImplement a BatchProcessor that:\n1. Collects events for a short window (e.g., 100ms)\n2. Deduplicates paths (if same file modified multiple times, process once)\n3. Processes all changed files in one batch\n4. Wraps database updates in a single transaction\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Reduces SQLite overhead (fewer transactions)\n- Natural deduplication of rapid changes\n- Better performance during bulk operations (git checkout, etc.)\n\n**Implementation sketch:**\n```rust\nstruct BatchProcessor {\n    pending_updates: HashSet\u003cPathBuf\u003e,\n    pending_deletes: HashSet\u003cPathBuf\u003e,\n    last_flush: Instant,\n    batch_interval: Duration,\n}\n```\n\n**Acceptance criteria:**\n- Events within batch window are deduplicated\n- Database updates wrapped in single transaction\n- Configurable batch interval\n- No event loss during batching","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-07T16:07:15.950038-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T16:21:50.070422-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T16:21:50.070422-08:00","labels":["cli","perf"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"RocketIndex-vzt","depends_on_id":"RocketIndex-l8s","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T16:07:46.826797-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"RocketIndex-vzt","depends_on_id":"RocketIndex-rxg","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T16:07:50.777756-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
